  <p> I started my career in outside sales. Building relationships and speaking with people was always very important to me. I found the first job that I really enjoyed with 1-800Raditor. I was very successful early on as a phone rep, my real skill
    was in selling to retail customers, though I wasn't bad at selling to our shop clients. I moved on to a franchise where I did outside sales and inventory management. In the first three years of doing ourside sales we went from selling just over
    one
    million a year to selling over 1.65 million a year. The accolaid got the attention of the corporate sales management team and from there I got to work with great mentors. I finally was at a job where I was
    utilizing my brain and my ability to consult with other. I quickly became one of their Senior Account Managers and was managing and coaching staff at 60 warehouses on a sales, inventory, operations, and at times finance. After the passing of my
    father my wife and I decided to move to Oregon, where she had been asking us to relocate for years. I still think fondly of the skills, experiences and people that I met at 1-800Radiator. I'm also looking forwrd to a new chapter in my life wher I
    can continue to utilize my brain and my love of relationship building.
